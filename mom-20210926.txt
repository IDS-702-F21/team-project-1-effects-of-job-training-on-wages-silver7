MoM:
  
  John showed his EDA on the variable re78
Satvik showed his eda on the variable re78-re74
Sarwari showed her eda on re78. she had removed observations with 14 ppl with no income ever and one person with too much income
Michelle showed her eda for part 2, including the glm model. Residual binned plots looked fine for the most part

Satvik showed basic model for re78-re74. Rsiduals plots look ed fine for the most part. too much income outlier needw to be dealt with

Disscussion on which outcome vairable to use and whether peopl with no income need to be excluded fromm part1 analysis. 
- Decided to use re78 - re74, without excluding people. (excpet heavy outlier maybe).
